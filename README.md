This repository contains the project, I have done during the Virtual Internship Program at Skill Intern India as a Data Science Intern

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p> This repository contains a data science project focused on predicting the percentage of a student based on the number of study hours. The project utilizes machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that can assist in estimating a student's performance given their study hours.</p>
<li> This project is based on Prediction using Supervised ML. </li>
<li> The data-set used here can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data </li>

<h2>Results</h2>
The model provided an Mean Absolute Error of 4.183859899002975 on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting student performance based on study hours.
